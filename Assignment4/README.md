# MSDS 6306 Assignment 4


This repository is for the 4th homework assignment of the 6306 class.

The Five Thirty Eight - Recent_College_Grads data is the basis of this information. There is a basic overview of the dataset and a simple barplot of the College Major Categories.
Their files and information can be found in this repository: https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight

A RMarkdown file shows the code used in RStudio to create the presentation. An html file is the formal output.

I can be reached at bkimbark@smu.edu for further information or questions.
